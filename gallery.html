                <p>Chandigarh: Amid concerns over water guzzling paddy crops likely to be cultivated over a larger area
                    in the state this season, the silver lining could be that more farmers are expected to opt for the
                    short duration paddy variety of PR 126. According to figures compiled by the agriculture department,
                    the area under the early maturing PR 126 rose from 5.59 lakh hectares in 2022 to 11.50 lakh hectares
                    in 2023 and this time it is likely to increase further.

                    During 2023, 44,852.20 quintals of certified seeds of PR 126 were made available to farmers through
                    various seed producing agencies and this year 58,999.44 quintals of certified seed has been provided

                <p>Abhishek Sharma has had quite an entertaining first week in India colours in Harare. Stepping up to
                    fill in the void left by giants Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, the dashing left-hander, just one T20I
                    old, whipped up a 46-ball century in his second game in as many days.

                    The 23-year-old failed to sparkle in the other two knocks. However, Abhishek has not let go of the
                    obsession to target the deep mid-wicket fence for sixes.

                    The Punjab and SRH batsman attempted a six on debut in that region but holed out for a duck. He went

                <p>Kathmandu: Nepal Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' on Friday lost a vote of confidence in
                    Parliament after the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) withdrew its
                    support for his government. Prachanda, 69, received 63 votes in the 275-member House of
                    Representatives (HoR). There were 194 votes against the motion. At least 138 votes are needed to win
                    the vote of trust. Prachanda has survived four trust votes since he assumed the post on December 25,
                    2022. Former prime minister K P Sharma Oli-led CPN-UML withdrew support from the Prachanda-led
                    government last week after inking a power-sharing deal with the largest party in the House - Nepali
                    Congress. Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba has already endorsed Oli as the next prime
                    minister.

                <p>New Delhi: Retail inflation rate accelerated to 5.08% in June from 4.75% in May, government data
                    showed on Friday. A Reuters poll of 54 economists had forecast retail inflation at 4.80%. The
                    inflation, however, remains within the Reserve Bank of India's comfort level of below 6 per cent.
                    The government has tasked the central bank to ensure retail inflation remains at 4 per cent with a
                    margin of 2 per cent on either side. The central bank mainly factors in the CPI to arrive at its
                    bi-monthly monetary policy decision. The next policy review is scheduled early next month.</p>

                    said, “No matter how many numbers they claim, when we came in 2014, our strength in the Rajya Sabha
                    was very low, and the Chair’s inclination was somewhat on the other side. But we did not waver from
                    our resolve to serve the country with pride.” “I want to tell the people of the country that the
                    decision you have made, the order you have given us to serve, neither Modi nor this government will
                    be afraid of any such obstacles. We will fulfill the resolutions we have set out to achieve,” Modi
                    had said.</p>
